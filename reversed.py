Tarot_r = {"The fool reversed":["An error of judgement. Bad advice takes you in the wrong direction, so investigate all offers carefully. The Fool reversed can also show deception. You may also be trying to force a situation, which can only backfire."],
"The magician reversed": ["Trickery; great plans have no foundation. This card often warns of others' motives, and they may not have your best interest at heart. It may also reveal frustration as, although you feel ready to move on, you meet restriction at every turn. If you are involved in the arts, a creative block is indicated."] ,
"High priestess reversed": ["Hidden information that may cause shock or disappointment is about to come to light. A secret is revealed that may incriminate someone you thought was above reproach. A trusted mentor is not all he or she seems. Take care whom you consult and confide in just now, from physics to older female relatives."],
"Empress reversed": ["The reversed Empress reveals difficulties with an older woman, such as a parent or mother-in-law, possibly involving clinginess or jealousy. Money problems at home manifest as miserliness or dangerous overspending. This card can also reveal parenting issues, which may involve confrontation."],
"Emperor reversed"	: "The Emperor reversed is a possessive, stubborn individual who wants to control others. You may be the victim, but examine your behavior because you may be dominating a person or situation needlessly. Whatever the situation, you or someone you know is losing perspective: it's time to take a step back.",
"Hierophant reversed":["The influence of an oppressive, older person who harangues you with unmasked-for advice. Do not be deceived by someone older in years because you assume they are wiser. The information may be wrong, and they may use their status to manipulate you."],
"The lovers reversed":	["Break-ups and commitment issues: one person may pull away from a relationship rather than work through difficulties. Tension mounts as imbalance and temptation creep in, such as seeking out an affair as a way of avoiding problems. Otherwise, this immaturity may be expressed as over dependence on a parent."],
"The chariot reversed":	["Ego and arrogance bring problems. Progress comes to a halt, or you feel that you are going in the wrong direction. On a mundane level, there could be a problem with transport, as plans go awry and a journey is delayed or abandoned."],
"Justice reversed": ["In the reversed position, Justice shows a miscarriage or justice. A decision goes against you, or a straightforward situation becomes unnecessarily complicated and the true facts of the matter become hidden. Others may act with bias, and you may overlook those who can support you at this difficult time. Judge yourself kindly and hold fast to your beliefs."],
"The hermit reversed":	["Enforced isolation. Refusal to learn or listen to advice may result in withdrawal from others in anger or resentment. You may need more time to come to terms with a situation you do not wish to accept. The Hermit reversed can also show an over analysis and a tendency to intellectualize rather than allowing feelings to surface."],
"Wheel of fortune reversed":	["The reversed wheel shows a downturn in fortune. You may have little influence over events at this time, but the situation will not prevail. As the wheel goes against you, so it can turn again in your favor."],
"Strength reversed":	["Curb baser instincts, such as overindulgence in food or overspending. Difficult emotions, such as anger, may need to be dealt with. You may be inclined to run away from problems rather than risk confrontation."],
"Hanged man reversed":	["Betrayal, often of the self. You may shy away from making a life-changing decision because it means initial discomfort or expense, and even yearn to return to the life you has as a dependent child. It is time to wake up from the reverie and confront whatever is causing anxiety."],
"Death reversed":	["An inability to give up what has already been taken. You may be living in the past more then you realize. Until you let go of the people or possessions that no longer represent who you are, or want to be, new opportunities are blocked. Surrender rather than waste time and energy clinging to suffocating familiarity."],
"Temperance reversed":	["You may feel overwhelmed, bonded to others' demands and under increasing pressure to cope. Money problems are often involved, so it is vital you deal with potential debt or resolve a deficit of time and energy."],
"The devil reversed":	["Obsession, such as an unhappy, destructive affair. When reversed, The Devil shows and inability or unwillingness to break a bond that has no future, due to immaturity, desperation, or low self-esteem. The card may indicate a struggle with addiction."],
"The tower reversed":	["An avoidable disaster. Your worst fears are realized as a relationship, business venture, or home project collapses -- and you know that you may be partly to blame. However, after anger at the sense of injustice comes guilt and, finally, a sense of relief. A struggle ends."],
"The star reversed":	["A creative or an emotional block, arises as a project or partnership loses it's way. You need direction, but beware of those who cultivate you for their own purpose. You may need to step out of an illusion and search for your star elsewhere."],
"The moon reversed":	["A failure of nerve. You do not trust your feelings and look to others for answers. Over dependence on a mentor figure could show you have begun to doubt your instincts. Moonlight can be deceptive -- so examine others' motives carefully before you commit. Don't settle for second best."],
"The sun reversed":	["Delay & Frustration. Your goal is just out of reach. Work or illness obstruct plans, and the paradise you had, envisaged is perilously close to slipping away. Vacations are cancelled, or a relationship does not materialize. Physically, your energy levels may be depleted."],
"Judgement reversed":	["Daily, due to the past getting in the way, or fear of change. You may judge yourself too harshly, or allow others to disregard your contribution, although this may be an excuse for not being able to let go. You may need to re-examine your attitudes and overcome feelings of guilt. What counts is what you believe about yourself."],
"The world reversed":	["Restriction. Failure to move forward is often due to indecision or negativity. Through feelings of being trapped in the past, or by the needs of others, your world seems to be growing smaller rather than expanding to welcome new people and opportunities. If you address what is really holding you back there is a chance for you to achieve your dream."]}
